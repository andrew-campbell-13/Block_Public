## Overview

Block is an IOS productivity app that allows the user to track their goals visually. Each journey is represented by a stack of blocks, with customisable colours and sizes. View progress individually or combined, and switch between light and dark modes to suit your preferences.

## Features

### Visual Progress Tracking
- **Block-Based Progress**: Add a block for each unit of progress you make, allowing you to visually track your journey step-by-step.
- **Journey Management**: Start, progress, and complete journeys. Completed journeys are saved for future reference.
- **Dynamic Progress Views**: View your progress as a stack of blocks or as columns representing each day's progress.
- **Customisable Layout**: Change the size of the blocks to fit your visual preferences and optimise your layout.
- **Completion Targets**: Easily see the target height for your stack and how much progress you've made towards completion.
- **Combined Progress View**: In a separate view, see the combined progress of all your goals. Blocks are colour-coded by journey, creating a multicoloured visual representation of your achievements.

### Customisation
- **Journey Colours**: Set a unique colour for each journey when you create it. This feature enhances the visual differentiation of your goals in the combined progress view.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark modes to match your device's theme or your personal preference.
